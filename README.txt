Welcome to the chord name generator.

The idea is simple, use this as a practice tool to aid you in exploring
guitar chords. Coupled with voice leading, this will challenge you
to see the surrounding chords better.

I have it setup with Major, Minor, Sus2, Sus4, Aug, and Dim chord qualities.
If you want to add more, simply modify the chordQualities array in the 
chord_name_scripts.js file. As for the chord names, I have included all names,
including contextual ones. example: B# and C (both are the same except in
context.)

Have fun!
